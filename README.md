# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to provide future stock buyers with a user-friendly workbook assessing returns on various eco-friendly stocks. The project uses VBA in order to achieve this. 

### Resources

Data Source: VBA_Challenge.xlsm

Software: Microsoft Excel, VBA

## Results
Using VBA, the following results were generated:

- For 2017:

![timing](https://github.com/annietresca/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge%202017.png)


- For 2018:

As can be seen in the above images, 2017 was a profitable year for all but one stock assessed! In fact, four of the stocks had over 100% return-- nearly unheard of! Contrastly, 2018 was a challenging year for almost all green stocks assessed with all but two being in the red. Of the two stocks that were not in the red, ENPH and RUN, ENPH came out on top for returns. In 2017, investors saw a 129.5% return and in 2018 they saw a 81.9% return.


## Summary
In general, refractoring code improves the speed with which code can be run. Refractoring code helps limit potential bugs and ensure the current/future coding environment is readable. Contrastly, refractoring code can be time consuming and thus costly. Because refractoring code relies heavily on the state of the work being reviewed, the time commitment to complete can be largely dependent on the most recent developers organization. 

In this specific analysis, refractoring the code from the original greenstocks.xlsm file worked on in the module greatly improved the execution time. Additionally, refractoring the code provided a visually appealing result with colors. Functionally speaking, both codes are the same as they both generate an analysis of each stock's performance. Because of this, one con to the refractored and original code is that it does not allow users to analyze a specific stock by name across years. Future coding to enable this feature would provide for a more robust output.
